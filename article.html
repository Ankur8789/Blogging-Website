                When did you last spot a house sparrow (Passer domesticus) in your house? Chances are, quite a while ago. These once-common birds are becoming a rarity, in India and other parts of the world. The Royal Society for Protection of Birds (rspb), uk, recently added the house sparrow to its Red List (for rapidly declining bird populations, which pose global conservation concern).
            </p>
            <p class="text-lines">
                Many of our so-called 'common' birds are at grave risk. This might sound a trifle melodramatic, but I'm definitely not exaggerating. At the beginning of the 19th century, few would have thought that the passenger pigeon would become extinct one day. But it did happen. The passenger pigeon population was estimated at between 5-10 billion in the first half of the 19th century. In the next few decades, all the birds were gone. Their demise was not due to disease or habitat destruction. The hapless avian species died out solely because it was mercilessly hunted down for meat.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lines">
                The white-backed vulture is another example. In 1995, during a workshop sponsored by the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology & Natural History (sacon), BirdLife International and the Wild Bird Society of Japan, Indian delegates were opposed to classifying the white-backed vulture under the "threatened" category. By 1998, the bird had become rare to spot. The 4000-odd vultures seen thronging Delhi's garbage dumping areas in the early 1980s had disappeared totally. Several theories were floated around after it was too late; preventive measures by airport authorities to reduce bird hits on planes, environmental contamination, poisoned carcasses and viral disease, to name a few.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lines">
                Pesticides kill... not only pests There are numerous other examples. Some of our insectivorous birds such as the drongo and the bee-eater have vanished from their traditional locales. The spectacular, long tubular nests of the baya, hanging from palm fronds, have become a sight of the past. Bayas today have become extremely rare to spot. In Rajasthan, sarus cranes have succumbed in large numbers to pesticide poisoning. In Bharatpur alone, 18 carcasses of sarus cranes were found within three years (1987-1990). The birds had fed on wheat treated with aldrin for protection from termites. Many ring doves also fell victim to the same chemical. Aldrin is now banned by the Indian government. But new chemicals such as chlorpyrifos and endosulfan are being used to check termites. It is not surprising then that the breeding population of the sarus crane has drastically declined. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-lines">
                The house sparrow is another fast disappearing 'common' bird. This avian species can still be spotted at over two-thirds of the world's land surface. But reports are pouring in from all over India and around the world of rapid decline in the populations of these once abundant birds.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lines">
                The ancient Romans introduced the house sparrow to Europe from North Africa and Eurasia. Human exploration and migration then took the bird to many other parts of the globe, including North and South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.

            </p>
            <p class="text-lines">
                Being a social bird, the sparrow thrived around human beings and where grain was abundant. Despite being derided as 'avian rat' in the late 19th century (for damaging cereal and other crops), the sparrow steadily 'colonised' a number of countries. The demise of vast numbers of this spunky bird is all the more shocking since it is a survivor; sparrows have been found breeding high up in the Himalaya and down below in Yorkshire coal mines.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lines">
                Avid bird-watchers from all over India have contacted sacon about the decline in the sparrow population of their locality or city. Subramanya, a sacon member in the National Wetland Conservation Programme and currently working with the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore, confirms the decline of sparrows in Bangalore. He attributes it to the lack of nesting sites in modern concrete buildings, disappearing kitchen gardens and the non-availability of a particular larvae (Helicoverpa armigera), associated with the field bean.

            </p>
            <p class="text-lines">
                To protect our avifauna and life-supporting systems from so-called 'development,' sacon has launched the Common Bird Conservation Pro gramme. This is in addition to the Endangered Species Conservation Programme, which is investigating factors affecting the populations of endangered birds. Under the new programme, a nationwide network of bird lovers will participate to address issues related to common birds. Relevant conservation information will be collected. In the first phase, the project will gather data on common birds, especially house sparrows, throughout the country.
 
            </p>
            <p class="text-lines">
                The scheme also aims to collect facts on habitat changes in a particular area. After preliminary analysis of the data, three to four areas where sparrow populations have fallen the most, will be selected for intensive study to identify the affecting factors. The project will include the various common bird species populating India's cities, suburbs and villages.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lines">
                I rest my case with a chilling thought from Guus Van der Poel of the Netherlands: "I am personally worried because the house sparrow shares it's environment with my own little grandchildren and the cause of the present decline of this species is unclear and perhaps, might even indicate noxious conditions for these birds which could also have long-term implications for my grandchildren -- who knows!"
